        "Although digital transactions in India registered a 51% growth in 2018-2019, their safety remains a concern. Fraudulent activities have increased severalfold, with approximately 52,304 cases of credit/debit card fraud reported in FY 2019 alone. Owing to this steep increase in banking frauds, it is the need of the hour to detect these fraudulent transactions in time to help consumers and banks that are losing their credit worth each day. Machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions.\n",

Immediately, you check your card details and realise that it will expire in the next eight days. Now, to renew your membership, the executive asks you to verify a few details such as your credit card number, the expiry date and the CVV number. Will you share these details with the executive?\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Card-not-present (CNP) fraud:** This occurs when the fraudster uses the card information to make online or phone transactions without having the physical card. This type of fraud is the most prevalent and accounts for `46%` of global credit card fraud losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Counterfeit and skimming fraud:** This occurs when the fraudster copies the card information from the magnetic stripe or the chip and creates a fake or cloned card. This type of fraud is usually done through skimming devices attached to ATMs, POS terminals, or gas pumps.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Lost and stolen card fraud:** This occurs when the fraudster obtains the physical card by stealing it from the cardholder or finding it misplaced. This type of fraud is the easiest to prevent by reporting the card as lost or stolen as soon as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Card-never-arrived fraud:** This occurs when the fraudster intercepts the card before it reaches the cardholder, such as in the mail or at the delivery point. This type of fraud can be avoided by tracking the card shipment and activating the card upon receipt.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **False application fraud:** This occurs when the fraudster uses someone else's personal information to apply for a new card or account. This type of fraud can be detected by monitoring the credit reports and alerts for any unauthorized inquiries or accounts.\n",

        "\n",
        "According to the latest statistics, credit card fraud worldwide reached `$32 billion` in **2021**, and it is expected to grow to `$43 billion` by **2026**. The US alone accounted for **38.6%** of global credit card fraud losses in **2018**, with `$9.47 billion`.\n",
